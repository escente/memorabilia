            <p>There we are! After 8 years and 941 pages, we’ve reached the end...</p>

            <p>It feels unreal to be writing this because I thought I’d never be able to finish drawing this story. In many ways I’m a different person now than at the start of the project. I’ve started and graduated from university, worked in two cities, made some very good friends… </p>

            <p>Back in 2015, I thought I would be able to finish the entire story in a year and 100 pages. Ignorance was bliss. If I knew this would take up most of my free time for 8 years I’d likely have reconsidered the whole endeavour.</p>

            <p>Until now I still have no idea if this story is good. It’s hard to have any perspective on something you’re working on. And that’s why I’m thankful to everyone who has left kind words on Tapas, social media or in my guestbook, for helping me get through moments of self-doubt. </p>

            <p>Thank you for reading. I didn’t think many people would finish this story with me. Yet here you are. You’re someone special.</p>
